# tmetric-clone




## Description

We have tried our best to make a fully-functional clone of Tmetric.com website that provides a minimal user experience where users can roam around and Assigned  their desired projects. 



## Motivation

One of our classmates was interested in self-improvement and had seen application on the app store with a similar concept. However, the apps didn't integrate gamification with self-improvement, so combining the two made sense. 

## Result

Using JavaScript, jQuery, front-end styling, the YouTube and They Said So APIs, and Firebase, we allow users to target specific areas of self-improvement that they want to work on. 



## Team Effort

ANSHUMAAN  DIVAYA  and RAMA worked on the user interface - from conception and planning to coding it out. GAJRAJ worked on the APIs and corresponding functionality to the topics page design. GYAN PRAKASH worked on Firebase, and the sign-ups through Google and Facebook. 

## Individual Responsibility

## Challenges

One of the biggest challenges that we encountered was using git merging and branches for the first time. We had to learn to stop being afraid of using git, and make it our friend. 

## Improvements

In the future, we can integrate more categories and more cards. We can also integrate a user page which will have some options for the user to allow push notifications and to see an overview of their progress.
